NAME
    get - get object information

SYNOPSIS
    get [OPTION]... [PATH] [FILTERS]

DESCRIPTION
    Retrieves object information from API and displays it's information in JSON format.

    If no PATH is given, then the current path will be used (equivalent to "get .").

    PATH can use the character * to use wildcards. A PATH equal to * means all objects in the current path.

    [FILTERS] is an optional list of filters that can be used to only get the objects that meet certain conditions.
    In order to use FILTERS, PATH must be present.
    The format to use is attribute1=expected_value,attribute2=expected_value,....

OPTIONS
    -r
        Specifies that you want to do a recursive get, i.e., not only get objects in the current path but the entire descendant hierarchy.
        Using -r with an exact PATH has no effect.
        Using -r with a wildcard (e.g. A*) will search for all objects with that name in the descendant hierarchy.

    -m min_depth
        Only affects when used in conjunction with -r.
        Specifies the minimum number of children between the PATH and the results.
        Default is 0.

    -M max_depth
        Only affects when used in conjunction with -r.
        Specifies the maximum number of children between the PATH and the results.
        Default is no limit.

    get SiteA
