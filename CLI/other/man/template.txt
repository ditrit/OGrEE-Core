USAGE: .template: [PATH]   
Loads a template from provided path.   
		
NOTE   
Complete path must be provided. At this time it is preferable to enclose the path in quotes. The template can then be invoked upon object creation by referring to the template by filename      

EXAMPLE   

    .template: ../../templates/roomTemplateA.json   
    .template: "path/to/templates/someTemplate.json"
