NAME
    lsOBJ - list children of a type

SYNOPSIS
    lsOBJ [OPTION]... [PATH] [COMPLEX FILTER OPTION] [FILTERS]

DESCRIPTION
    Lists the children of type OBJ of the specified path (equivalent to ls with filter: category=[type]).
    Where OBJ can be:
        site
        building
        room
        rack
        dev
        ac
        cabinet
        corridor
        panel

    If no PATH is given, then the current path will be used (equivalent to "ls .").

    [FILTERS] is an optional set of filters that can be used to only list the children that meet certain conditions.
    In order to use FILTERS, PATH must be present.
    COMPLEX FILTERS can be used, composing complex boolean expressions with the operators `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `&` and `|`.
    The option `-f` before the complex filter is required.
    If `-f` is not set, a simple filter (single condition) can be applied with the format attribute=expected_value

OPTIONS
    -s attribute_name
        Specifies the attribute of the objects to be used to sort the results.
        By default, the results are listed in alphabetical order according to their name.

    -a attributes
        The results are listed with the attributes present in format.
        The format of attributes is a list separated by : (attribute1:attribute2:...)

    -r
        Specifies that you want to do a recursive ls, i.e., not only list the direct children but the entire descendant hierarchy.
        This option can only be used when there are FILTERS or the PATH is a layer.

    -m min_depth
        Only affects when used in conjunction with -r.
        Specifies the minimum number of children between the PATH and the listed results.
        Default is 0.

    -M max_depth
        Only affects when used in conjunction with -r.
        Specifies the maximum number of children between the PATH and the listed results.
        Default is no limit.

    -f
        Specifies that you want to define a complex filter expression with the operators `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `&` and `|`.
        Regular filters can be used normally.

EXAMPLES
    lssite
    lsbuilding DEMO_RACK/DeviceA
    lsroom /Physical/SiteA
    lsrack $x
    lsdev -s height
    lsac -a height:size
    lscabinet -s height -a size
    lscorridor . height=12
    lspanel -r .
    lssite -r -m 1 -M 2 .
