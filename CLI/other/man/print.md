USAGE: print  \"anything you want\"   
Prints data to output   

NOTE   
print command will not perform arithmetic or any other calculation on it's arguments and will print them directly with the exception of concatenate which is still primitive. Thus printing "hey""another will return "hey""another. Multiple arguments are only supported if concatenated within quotes.    

EXAMPLE   

    print "Welcome to OGrEE"   
    print $x
    print "$x/another/path"
