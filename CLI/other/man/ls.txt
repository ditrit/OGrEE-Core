NAME
    ls - list children

SYNOPSIS
    ls [OPTION]... [PATH] [FILTERS]

DESCRIPTION
    Lists the children of the specified path.

    If no PATH is given, then the current path will be used (equivalent to "ls .").

    [FILTERS] is an optional list of filters that can be used to only list the children that meet certain conditions.
    In order to use FILTERS, PATH must be present.
    The format to use is attribute1=expected_value,attribute2=expected_value,....

OPTIONS
    -s attribute_name
        Specifies the attribute of the objects to be used to sort the results.
        By default, the results are listed in alphabetical order according to their name.

    -f attributes
        The results are listed with the attributes present in format.
        The format of attributes is a list separated by : (attribute1:attribute2:...)

    -r
        Specifies that you want to do a recursive ls, i.e., not only list the direct children but the entire descendant hierarchy.
        This option can only be used when there are FILTERS or the PATH is a layer.

    -m min_depth
        Only affects when used in conjunction with -r.
        Specifies the minimum number of children between the PATH and the listed results.
        Default is 0.

    -M max_depth
        Only affects when used in conjunction with -r.
        Specifies the maximum number of children between the PATH and the listed results.
        Default is no limit.
