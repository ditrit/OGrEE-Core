Welcome to the OGrEE-Core wiki!

# What is OGrEE ?
OGrEE stands for Offline Graph End to End  
Offline    : no connection with customer SI : only logs (securely) stored somewhere !  
Graph      : try to link / draw component / informations and their relationships  
End-to-End : depending on informations found in logs, OGrEE is able to :
  - make the complete I/O path between a "disk" seen under Linux and the way it is built in the storage array, with internal / external replication and full SAN path.
  - list/display all impacted devices in DC when maintenance team ask for a PowerPanel maintenance PowerPanel/PowerFeed/PDU/PSU/Devices)
  - Displayed information could be more precise if more useful logs are given.  

OGrEE is neither SPLUNK, nor a DCIM (netbox) nor an ELK...   


# And OGrEE-3D ?
This is the OGrEE 3D client: a 3D front end part of OGrEE, based on Unity game engine.  
It will display data from OGrEE using OGrEE-CLI.  
You can access to the OGrEE-3D repo [here](https://github.com/ditrit/OGrEE-3D).  

OGrEE 3D was firstly designed
- to help "non certified" technicians to replace spare parts in complex IT devices
- to avoid loosing time updating "vision/draw.io" schemas
- to propose a funny-visual-3D representation of a datacenter with the ability to display any kind of information on 3D objects
